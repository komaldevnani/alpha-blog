        You're getting this error now because Rails expects plain actions like 
        this one to have views associated with them to display their information.
        With no view available, Rails will raise an exception.
        Let's look at the full error message again:
        ArticlesController#new is missing a template for this request format
        and variant. request.formats: ["text/html"] request.variant: [] 
        NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond 
        with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in 
        a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template,
        notâ€¦ nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect
        204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. 
        Give it a shot.
        That's quite a lot of text! Let's quickly go through and understand what
        each part of it means.
        The first part identifies which template is missing. In this case, it's 
        the articles/new template. Rails will first look for this template. 
        If not found, then it will attempt to load a template called application/new. 
        It looks for one here because the ArticlesController inherits from ApplicationController.
        The next part of the message contains request.formats which specifies 
        the format of template to be served in response. It is set to text/html 
        as we requested this page via browser, so Rails is looking for an HTML template. 
        request.variant specifies what kind of physical devices would be served 
        by the response and helps Rails determine which template to use in the response. 
        It is empty because no information has been provided.
